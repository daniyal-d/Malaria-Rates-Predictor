# Malaria-Rates-Predictor
Created for my IB Biology HL Internal Assessment. Studies have showcased that malaria-carrying mosquitos tend to thrive in high precipitaiton areas, and this investigation aims to explore the relationship between malaria rates and precipitation rates.

Determined that there is a statistically significant difference between selected countries considered to have "low" precipitation rates and "high" precipitation rates. View the Jupyter Notebook for a more detailed explanation and source code

Potential To Dos: Add more data, view larger countries, add more features, analyze potential feature selection
